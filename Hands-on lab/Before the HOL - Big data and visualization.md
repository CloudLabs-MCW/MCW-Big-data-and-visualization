   ![The Azure storage account creation form is filled out with values as outlined above.](media/azure-storage-create-blade.png)

4. Select **Review + create (8)**.

5. Wait for validation to pass, then select **Create**.

### Task 3: Create a storage container

In this task, you will create a storage container to store your flight and weather data files.

1. From the home page in the Azure portal, choose **Resource groups**, then enter your resource group name into the filter box, and select it from the list.

   ![Azure Portal is open. Resource Groups button is highlighted.](media/select-resource-groups.png)

2. Next, select your lab Azure Storage account from the list.

   ![The Azure Storage account that you created in the previous task is selected from within your lab resource group.](media/select-azure-storage-account.png)

3. Select **Containers (1)** from the menu. Select **+ Container (2)** on the Containers blade, enter **sparkcontainer** for the name **(3)**, leaving the public access level set to Private. Select **Create (4)** to create the container.

   ![The Containers menu item located in the Blob service section is selected from the menu. The + Container item is selected in the toolbar. The New container form is populated with the values outlined above.](media/azure-storage-create-container.png)

### Task 4: Provision Azure Data Factory

Create a new Azure Data Factory instance that will be used to orchestrate data transfers for analysis.

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) (<https://portal.azure.com>), select **Create a resource** within the portal menu, then type "Data Factory" into the search bar.

   ![The Create a resource item is selected from the Azure portal page](media/azure-portal-create-resource.png)

2. Select **Create**.

   ![Data Factory Page is open. Create button is highlighted.](media/create-azure-data-factory.png)

3. Set the following configuration on the Data Factory creation form:

   - **Subscription (1)**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

   - **Resource Group (2)**: Select the same resource group you created at the beginning of this lab.

   - **Region (3)**: Select any region close to you.

   - **Name (4)**: Enter a unique name, this is indicated by a green checkmark.

   - **Version (5)**: Select **V2**

   **_Understanding Data Factory Location:_**
   The Data Factory location is where the data factory's metadata is stored and where the triggering of the pipeline is initiated from. Meanwhile, a data factory can access data stores and compute services in other Azure regions to move data between data stores or process data using compute services. This behavior is realized through the [globally available IR](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=data-factory) to ensure data compliance, efficiency, and reduced network egress costs.

   The IR Location defines the location of its back-end compute, and essentially the location where the data movement, activity dispatching, and SSIS package execution are performed. The IR location can be different from the location of the data factory it belongs to.

   ![The Azure Data Factory creation form is populated with the values as outlined above.](media/azure-data-factory-create-blade-updated.PNG "Configuring the correct settings for ADF")

4. Select **Next: Git configuration > (6)** to continue.

5. Check **Configure Git later (1)** and select **Review + create (2)** to proceed.

   ![The Azure Data Factory Git configuration is disabled.](media/azure-data-factory-configure-git-later.PNG "Accessing the Git configuration tab to prevent it from being enabled during ADF creation")

6. Select **Create** to finish and submit.

### Task 5: Download and install Power BI Desktop

Power BI desktop is required to connect to your Azure Databricks environment when creating the Power BI dashboard.

1. Download and install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

### Task 6: (Optional) Provision a VM to install the Integration Runtime On

An integration runtime agent for Azure Data Factory will need to be installed on your hardware for the hands-on lab. Since you will need to provide your user credentials, we suggest you provision an Azure VM to act as your "on-premises" hardware.

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) (<https://portal.azure.com>), select **Create a resource** within the portal menu, then type "Data Factory" into the search bar.

   ![The Create a resource item is selected from the Azure portal page](media/azure-portal-create-resource.png)

2. Select **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter** from Azure Marketplace.

   ![Selecting the Windows Server 2016 Datacenter VM image from Azure Marketplace.](media/windows-server-2016-for-ir.png "Choosing a marketplace VM image to host the IR")

3. On the **Create a virtual machine** page, specify the following parameters:

   - **Subscription (1)**: Provide the subscription you have been using for this lab.

   - **Resource group (2)**: Provide your resource group.

   - **Virtual machine name (3)**: Provide something descriptive.

   - **Region (4)**: Provide the same location as your ADF instance.
